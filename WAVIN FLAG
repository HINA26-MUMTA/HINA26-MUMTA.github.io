    <h1>wavin' flag</h1>
    <p>Give me freedom, give me fire <br>
Give me reason, take me higher<br>
See the champions take the field now<BR>
You define us, make us feel proud<BR>

In the streets our heads are liftin'<BR>
As we lose our inhibition<BR>
Celebration, it surrounds us<BR>
Every nation, all around us<BR>

Saying forever young<BR>
Singing songs underneath the sun<BR>
Let's rejoice in the beautiful game<BR>
And together at the end of the day, we all say<BR>

When I get older I will be stronger<BR>
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag<BR>
When I get older I will be stronger<BR>
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag.</p>
